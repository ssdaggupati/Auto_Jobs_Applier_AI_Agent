def generate_regex_patterns_for_blacklisting(blacklist):
    """
    Converts each blacklist entry to a regex pattern that ensures exact matches of all words appear, in any order.
    Handles special cases for terms like ".NET", "C++", and "C#", ensuring they are correctly matched.

    Parameters:
        blacklist (list of str): A list of terms to blacklist.

    Returns:
        list of str: A list of regex patterns corresponding to the blacklist terms.

    Example:
        Input:
            blacklist = ["Data Engineer", "C++", "C#", ".NET"]

        Output:
            [
                '(?i)(?=.*\\bdata\\b)(?=.*\\bengineer\\b)',
                '(?i)C\\+\\+',
                '(?i)C\\#',
                '(?i)\\.?NET'
            ]

    Explanation:
        - '(?=.*\\bword\\b)': Ensures the word appears as a separate entity (with word boundaries).
        - '(?i)': Enables case-insensitive matching.
        - Special cases (".NET", "C++", "C#") are handled explicitly to ensure accurate matches.
